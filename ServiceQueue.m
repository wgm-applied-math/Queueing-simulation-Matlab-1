% MATLAB-ism: The notation 
% 
%   classdef ServiceQueue < handle
% 
% makes ServiceQueue a subclass of handle, which means that this is a
% "handle" class, so instances have "handle" semantics. When you assign an
% instance to a variable, as in
%
%   q1 = ServiceQueue()
%   q2 = q1
%
% a handle (or reference) to the object is assigned rather than an
% independent copy.  That is, q1 and q2 are handles to the same object.
% Changes made using q1 will affect q2, and vice-versa.
%
% In contrast, classes that aren't derived from handle are "value" classes.
% When you assign an instance to a variable, an independent copy is made.
% This is MATLAB's usual array behavior:
%
%  u = [1,2,3] v = u v(1) = 10
%
% After the above, u is still [1,2,3] and v is [10,2,3] because the
% assignment v = u copies the array.  The change to v(1) doesn't affect the
% copy in u.
%
% Importantly, copies of value objects are made when they are passed to
% functions.
%
% Handle semantics are used for this simulation, so that methods are able
% to change the state of a ServiceQueue object.  That is, something like
%
%  q = ServiceQueue() handle_next_event(q)
%
% creates a ServiceQueue object and calls a method that changes its state.
% If ServiceQueue was a value class, the instance would be copied when
% passed to the handle_next_event method, and no changes could be made to
% the copy stored in the variable q.
